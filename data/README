##### DATA DESCRIPTION #####

2. scATAC: The datasets for running with the SCAVENGE related scripts
        2.1 SCAVENGE:
                2.1.1. trait_enrichment: the r object for the summarised experiment for the COVID-19 PBMCs for finding COVID-19 associated trait enrichment in different cell types
                2.1.2. scoring: the r object for the summarised experiment for cell type score comparison across the SNP classes after running SCAVENGE

	2.2. trait_bed_files/ : The directory contains the bed files for the different SNP classes as described in the study for the two COVID-19 illness associated phenoypes: Hospitalization and Severe respiratory illness 
Abbreviations are described below:
	gws: genome wide siginficant - SNPs selected at the p-value threshold 5 x 10^-8 
	interface: Interface SNPs selected at p<0.001 
	negcontrols: SNPs selected at p>0.1 
	not.interface: SNPs selected at p<0.001 away from the structural interfaces of PPIs
