##### DATA DESCRIPTION #####

1. scATAC: The datasets for running with the SCAVENGE related scripts
        1.1 SCAVENGE:
                1.1.1. trait_enrichment: the r object for the summarised experiment for the COVID-19 PBMCs for finding COVID-19 associated trait enrichment in different cell types
                1.1.2. scoring: the r object for the summarised experiment for cell type score comparison across the SNP classes after running SCAVENGE

        1.2. trait_bed_files/ : The directory contains the bed files for the different SNP classes as described in the study for the two COVID-19 illness associated phenoypes: Hospitalization and Severe respiratory illness
Abbreviations are described below:
        gws: genome wide siginficant - SNPs selected at the p-value threshold 5 x 10^-8
        interface: Interface SNPs selected at p<0.001
        negcontrols: SNPs selected at p>0.1
        not.interface: SNPs selected at p<0.001 away from the structural interfaces of PPIs
2. scRNA_seq: The datasets for runnign scRNA_seq pipeline:
        2.1 example: Example datasets and directory structure to run the pipeline as described in the scripts/scRNA_seq_pipeline/README
        2.2 ref_files_for_snp_mapping: Files needed to map gws/negcontrol SNPs to genes
        2.3 reproducibility: Bed files for GWAS summary stats for different COVID-19 associated phenotypes that were used for results reported in the manuscript
                2.3.1 A2: Severe respiratory illness
                2.3.2 B2: Hospitalization
                All SNP nomenclature same as described for scATAC
